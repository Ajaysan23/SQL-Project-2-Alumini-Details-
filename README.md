#SQL Project-Alimni Database

Once a student is passed out from a Institute or College, he/she is known as Alumni of the Institute. Alumni’s career growth plays important role in Institute’s ranking and other networking activities. In this project, career choices of alumni of two Universities will be analyzed with respect to their passing year as well as the course they completed.
